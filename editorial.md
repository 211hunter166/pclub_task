##### The maximum number of bullets required would be equal to the number n itself.
##### But when the position of enemy at elevation L is before than the enemy at elevation L-1, then the bullet hitting L will also hit L-1.
##### So we just need to find the number of cases where position of L-1 is before the position of L. And the count of all such case will give the minimum number of bullets.
